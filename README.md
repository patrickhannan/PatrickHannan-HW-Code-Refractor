## Description 

This project is webpage title "Horiseon", and the main goal of this webpage is for users to better their understandings of the internet and how they can optimize it, manage it, and marketing through it. Overall the goal is for the user to have better awareness when it comes to their online presence and internet usage. Additionally, a personal reasoning behind working on this page was to refractor the code in order to create a codebase that obeys accessibility standards, thus optimizing this site for search engines.

## Usage 

When on the webpage, there are three main sections, as well as an aside. These can be access in a couple of ways.

To access the main sections, their is a navbar at the top of the page with three listings: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. By clicking any one of these listing, the user will be immediately directed to the corresponding section, where they will see information that will teach the user about each of these categories. 

Additionally, the user can use the scroll bar on the right side of their screen to access these sections manually.

In order to access the aside, the user must either scroll down the webpage manually, or click one of the listings in the navbar for the main sections. There is no direct access to the aside, but it is next to the main sections on the webpage so it accessable. This aside will provide the user with benefits of Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management. These three benefits correspond to main section that they are aside from.

For example, if you want to view the benefits of Online Reputation Management, the aside will be to the right and the user will see that the benefit is "Brand Awareness". There will be a description of this benefit below the title "Brand Awareness".
